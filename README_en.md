## Code Explanation

### Main Method

#### Java Example

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
```

- The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the program.

#### C Example

```c
int main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a C program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the operating system and the program.

#### Go Example

```go
func main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a Go program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the Go runtime and the program.

#### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a JavaScript program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the JavaScript engine and the program.

#### Rust Example

```rust
fn main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a Rust program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the Rust runtime and the program.

#### Batch Example

```batch
@echo off
echo Hello World
```

- The batch script uses the `echo` command to output text.

#### Brainfuck Example

```brainfuck
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.
```

- Brainfuck uses a series of instructions to control memory cells and output.

#### Wenyan Example

```Wenyan
是術曰。
    ...
是謂「問天地好在」之術也。
```

- `是術曰` is the entry point of a Wenyan program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core identifier recognized by the Wenyan compiler.

### Output Statements

#### Java Example

```java
System.out.print("Hello "); // Print "Hello" without a newline
System.out.println("World"); // Print "World" with a newline
```

- `System.out.print`: Outputs text through the standard output stream without adding a newline character, reflecting precise control over the output stream.
- `System.out.println`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### C Example

```c
printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `printf`: Outputs text through the standard output stream, where `\n` represents a newline character, reflecting precise control over the output stream.

#### Go Example

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, World!") // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `fmt.Println`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### JavaScript Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `console.log`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### Rust Example

```rust
println!("Hello, World!"); // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `println!`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### Batch Example

```batch
echo Hello World
```

- `echo`: Outputs text through the command line.

#### Brainfuck Example

```brainfuck
++++++++[>++++[>++>+++>+++>+<<<<-]>+>+>->>+[<]<-]>>.>---.+++++++..+++.>>.<-.<.+++.------.--------.>>+.
```

- Brainfuck controls memory cells and character output to achieve text output.

#### Wenyan Example

```Wenyan
吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在」」。	// Define a variable with the value "問天地好在"
書之。 						// Print "問天地好在" with a newline
```

- `書之`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.
