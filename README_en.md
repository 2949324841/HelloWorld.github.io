# Introduction
 This is a "Hello, World" code written during my spare time. After careful consideration, I've decided to open - source it. To ensure the continuous development of this program, we will seriously take into account all feedback and keep updating it.
 
# Get Involved
 If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork the repository. You can create "Hello, World" programs in any language and in any form. Just place the files in the directory corresponding to the language within the HelloWorld project. If the language directory doesn't exist, you can create it yourself. There are no restrictions on file naming.
