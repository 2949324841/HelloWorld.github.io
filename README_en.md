# README: HelloWorld Project

## Project Introduction

**HelloWorld** is a historically significant multi-language project that represents a milestone in human-machine interaction. It is not only a technical achievement but also an important milestone in the history of programming languages. Through this code, we have achieved precise control over computer output, ushering in a new era of human-machine dialogue.

## Features

This project uses the core mechanisms of various programming languages to achieve precise control over output streams, producing the following output:

```text
Hello World
```

This seemingly simple output reflects a deep understanding of the I/O stream mechanisms of various programming languages and efficient utilization of system resources.

## Code Explanation

### Main Method

#### Java Example

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
```

- The `main` method is the entry point of a Java program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and the program.

#### C Example

```c
int main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a C program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the operating system and the program.

#### Go Example

```go
func main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a Go program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the Go runtime and the program.

#### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function main() {
```

- The `main` function is the entry point of a JavaScript program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the JavaScript engine and the program.

#### Wenyan Example

```Wenyan
是術曰。
	...
是謂「問天地好在」之術也。
```

- The `是術曰` function is the entry point of a Wenyan program. The program starts executing from here. It is the core interface between the Wenyan compiler and the program.

### Output Statements

#### Java Example

```java
System.out.print("Hello "); // Print "Hello" without a newline
System.out.println("World"); // Print "World" with a newline
```

- `System.out.print`: Outputs text through the standard output stream without adding a newline character, reflecting precise control over the output stream.
- `System.out.println`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### C Example

```c
printf("Hello, World!\n"); // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `printf`: Outputs text through the standard output stream, where `\n` represents a newline character, reflecting precise control over the output stream.

#### Go Example

```go
fmt.Println("Hello, World!") // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `fmt.Println`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### JavaScript Example

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!"); // Print "Hello, World!" with a newline
```

- `console.log`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.

#### Wenyan Example

```Wenyan
吾有一言。曰「「問天地好在」」。	// Define a variable with the value "問天地好在"
書之。 						// Print "問天地好在" with a newline
```

- `書之`: Outputs text through the standard output stream and adds a newline character afterward, ensuring standardized output formatting.
